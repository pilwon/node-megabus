# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made it easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> The module was easy to understand because it provided some clear and easy examples to follow along. Additiaonlly the source code was well written with self-explanatory variable names and funtions. The code was also abstract enough to follow and not super confusing. However, the use promises threw me off. With some comments explaning what the code is doing would have been very helpful to understand the module fully.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Comments that raise the level of abstractions means writing a comment that describes the premise of the function, without giving implementation details. I would tell a new CSE142 student to create comments that summarizes what the function does similar to the documentation details. Rather than describe how the function does it.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> I spent about 10 hours on this assignment. Most of the time was spent finding a module that was short and easy to understand, and figuring out which source code file I should be commenting on and the style of commenting that I should be doing. I don't mean understanding JSDoc. JSDoc is easy to understand, but styling the comments was confusing.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I wasn't able to find a module that was easy to understand. Additionally, I wasn't really sure how to start this assignment. Nikki Nikkhoui suggested the `npm-megabus` module as well as helped me undertand some aspects of the module.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Yes! It was very difficult finding modules that were easy and short enough to understand. Additionally, I spent a lot of time figuring out which file was the source code to begin commenting. Lastly, it was not very clear how we should be commenting (i.e.: @method vs @function, commenting above the funciton within the function etc.). Having an example of the commenting style would have been very helpful. Lack of uniformity, was also dificulty. It was hard to ask peers for help because everyone was working on a different module with differnt code style, file structures, etc.
